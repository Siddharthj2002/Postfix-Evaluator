# Postfix-Evaluator

● Project Description:

An evaluator for postfix expressions. The evaluator is stack-based, and capable of evaluating correctly formed but otherwise arbitrary arithmetic expressions on integers. The implementation of the stack is done using linked-lists.

● Project Goals:


  -> Demonstrate understanding of a linked-list-based stack implementation.
  
  -> Use Interfaces and Abstract classes to separate implementation from usage.
  
  -> Understand and implement the core of a stack-based postfix expression evaluator.
  
  -> Experience debugging and testing code.

● Project Background

  Postfix Expressions : A postfix expression evaluator takes as input an arithmetic expression, written in         postfix notation, and computes and returns the result. Typically arithmetic is written in infix notation,
  where the operator, such as “+”, is written between the two operands, such as “1 + 5”. Postfix
  notation* places the operator after the operands. Postfix notation is unambiguous about the
  order of operations when evaluating an expression, unlike infix notation, which requires rules
  of operator precedence and parentheses to be unambiguous.
  For example, the postfix expression: 4 5 7 2 + - *
  is equivalent to the infix expression: 4 * (5 - (7 + 2))

  ● Code Structure:
  
  This project contains the following important folders:
  
  -> src: This is the source folder which consists of all the important files and code related to this project.
  
  -> src/test: This is the package folder containing all of the public unit tests.
  
  -> lib: This is where you can find libraries that are included with the project. At the very
          least you will find two jar files that are used to run the JUnit test framework.
